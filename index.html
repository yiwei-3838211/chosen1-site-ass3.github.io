						<h3>Group Process</h3>
						<p>In Assignment 2, all group members made a significant contribution to the group project.
							Firstly, the atmosphere of our group was quite harmonious and cooperative. As group members
							were unique individuals, it was common to hold different opinions while working together.
							However, we always had a small discussion at first, and then we voted to make a decision
							which was the most effective way to solve conflicts. Secondly, although the group project
							had a heavy workload, all group members assigned the large amount of work equally and
							rationally. Even if group members completed their parts early, they volunteered to help
							others if they had any difficulties in the project. We would like to persist these
							outstanding contributions in our next group assignment. Conversely, there are also some
							improvements that we can make in Assignment 3. The most important thing that we need to
							enhance is time management. Because it is close to the final term, we should reasonably
							schedule and plan our timetable in order to complete all assignments effectively with
							advanced quality. Additionally, a new group member joins our team in Assignment 3. We should
							adapt to the slight changes as soon as possible. It is crucial to build a reliable and tied
							bond with new group members which can boost our efficiency in a project.</p>

					<h3>Q: What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if
						anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h3>
					<p>A: The common element for these ideal jobs is that they are all technically-related. They all
						require related technical or analytic experiences. Additionally, the collaborative abilities are
						all expected for the jobs’ requirements. Conversely, the difference is that some ideal jobs are
						more related to professional information technology skills. And other jobs only require relative
						backgrounds in learning IT and basic knowledge of techniques. We all have similar positions in
						groups when considering career plans. All group members develop the correlated skills and obtain

					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<h2>
						Topic
					</h2>
					<p>
						Online education refers to the method of content dissemination and rapid learning through the
						application of information technology and internet technology. In recent years, the development
						of hardware devices, online real-time transmission technology has driven the rapid development
						of online education. At present, the technology of online education is mainly based on
						interactive platforms and intelligent systems. And with the continuous development of
						technology, more and more technologies are applied to online education platforms to optimize the
						teaching experience and effectiveness of the platforms and promote the upgrading of products and
						services in the online education industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						Compared to traditional offline education methods, online education can break the constraints of
						time and space, meet the needs of consumers to obtain education in fragmented time, and make up
						for the shortcomings of traditional education learning time and place inflexibility. The
						application of artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies in the internet
						education industry can enable educators to grasp the learning situation of users in real time
						and accurately. Under the premise of resource sharing, users have a high degree of freedom in
						choosing education brands and teaching styles.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Motivation
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the first half of 2020, influenced by the COVID-19, the penetration rate of the online
						education industry increased significantly. Over 1.2 billion youngsters are out of school
						worldwide. The epidemic has brought forward the overall process of the online education industry
						by three to five years. The online education industry has seen a significant increase in
						penetration, opening the valve for users to shift from offline to online and change their
						behavioural habits. Meanwhile, the penetration of big data and AI technologies in education will
						continue to deepen. Online learning industry became the focus of capital development, and the
						major Internet giants also accelerated their entry into the game.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Landscape
					</h2>
					<p>
						Recently, there are many established online education platforms which are already in the market
						and widely used, such as Udemy, Coursera and Skillshare. However, the challenges also exist for
						online institutions in promoting online learning and teaching. Firstly, the pressure on the
						server multiplied during the epidemic, and the live streaming lag, delay and crash phenomenon
						affect the teaching effect. Secondly, poor interactivity in online classes and lack of feedback
						and analysis systems make it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. For our new online
						learning platforms, we will devote ourselves to creating optimization systems in order to deal
						with basic technical issues such as delayed transmission and video lag.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Detailed Description
					</h1>
					<h2>
						Aims
					</h2>
					<p>
						The purpose of this project is to create a platform that allows students to take classes
						anywhere. The aim is to enable some students who are far away from the campus due to unavoidable
						factors to obtain the same teaching quality.
					</p>
					<p>This project has the following objectives</p>
					<h3>
						A) Accessibility Of Time And Place
					</h3>
					<p>
						The advantage of online education is that it allows students to take classes from any location
						they choose. This software needs to allow students to use this software for classes at home away
						from school. And also It can allow schools to reach a wider network of students without being
						restricted by geographic boundaries.
					</p>
					<h3>
						B) High Efficiency
					</h3>
					<p>
						Online learning provides teachers with an effective way to teach students. There are many tools
						for this software that need to be included, such as videos, podcasts, and PDFs. Teachers can use
						these tools for part of their lesson plans. This can enable teachers to become more efficient
						educators if they extend their lesson plans beyond traditional textbooks to include online
						resources.
					</p>
					<h3>
						C) Inexpensive
					</h3>
					<p>
						Another important advantage of online learning is that it can reduce costs. Because Online
						learning needs to eliminate student transportation, student meals, and most importantly real
						estate costs. And all courses or learning materials need to be available online, it can create a
						paperless learning environment that is more economical and beneficial to the environment.
					</p>
					<h3>
						D) Can Suits A Variety Of Learning Styles
					</h3>
					<p>
						Every student has a different learning process and learning style. Some students are visual
						learners, and others prefer to learn through audio. This software will provide a variety of
						options and resources, which allows each student to choose the learning styles they need.
					</p>
					<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
					<p>
						In this project, According to the plan, when it is completed it will be an online education
						platform. This software will be able to run on windows, ios and android. When it is delivered,
						the functions that it should have include online video, online chat and online screen sharing.
						For the tools in the software, such as drawing and emoticons, we will use things that already
						exist. This software can be used without creating a personal account. Setting up a server is not
						planned in this project.
					</p>
					<h2>Risks</h2>
					<p>
						The risks included in this project will be the following
					</p>
					<h3>
						A) The network latency is too high during a video call
					</h3>
					<p>
						Because this software will be used all over the world, the distance between lecturers and
						students may be too far. Such as Australia and the United States. This may result in students
						not being able to interact with the lecturer, even unable to see the lecturer’s sharing screen.
						The possible solution to this problem is to build more servers in the future
					</p>
					<h3>
						B) Time zone differences
					</h3>
					<p>
						Sometimes, it can be difficult to have a video conference with people in the country or other
						parts of the world just because of the time zone. For example, the 3:00 pm meeting in the United
						States will be in the middle of the night in England. A possible solution to this problem is to
						add meeting recording tools
					</p>
					<h3>
						C) The software is too complicated to use
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this project, this software may be too complicated for users. This causes users to spend a
						lot of time learning how to use it. The possible solution to this problem is to make the
						software design as simple and easy to use as possible.

			<div class="col-9">
				<section class="qAndABox box style1">
					<h3>Individual Reflection</h3>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Lanbo Gao</strong></p>
					<p> I made a great contribution to this group assignment. I did much communication work with team
						members and tutor. To improve the quality of the assignment , I suggested changing another
						project and confirming the feasibility of the new project with the tutor. I advocate making
						changes according to feedback and optimizing the plan. In addition, I also play the role of
						meeting planner. Meeting is definitely a quite significant part of a group project. It is
						commonly believed as a fact that meeting with high-efficiency could be the drive in order to
						make progress. I coordinate meeting schedules and make meeting agenda. On the other hand, I have
						high requirements for my allocated work. I would like to listen to others when differences of
						opinion happen and reflect on myself. However, there is still something I need to improve. First
						of all, I think I need to improve my creativity. Exploring divergent thinking ability will be
						crucial to my career in the future, especially in the IT industry. After that, I believe I
						should enhance my coding ability. It is a very important foundation for my career. Finally,
						through the group assignment, I found that leadership is another soft skill I need to learn
						more.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Yiwei Lin</strong></p>
					<p> I help my team members ease the embarrassment at the meeting, and every time each group member
						will participate in the meeting that is really good for the assignment. But we are doing our
						part of the time which is not always the plan time to complete, in this case we should improve,
						we assign each person to do part of the relatively average without objection. For the web page
						model, although it took a lot of time, the web page did not achieve the expected effect due to
						my limited skill and some late time to start the webPage. I have to say that it is a pity that I
						have not learned enough at ordinary times. In the future, I will make up for these deficiencies.
						As for my coding and communication skills, there is still a lot of space for improvement. If my
						coding skills are good enough, we do not need to use a website builder to help us build the
						website. Our group lost a member in the assignment2, but added a new member in the assignment3,
						which surprised me. </p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Xingyu Zhou</strong></p>
					<p>For our assignment 3. Our group has a very smooth process to finish it. Every member has made a
						great contribution. When our team members assign tasks. Each of our team members can choose the
						appropriate part. One thing we can improve is the speed of finishing our assignment because most
						of our work is done in the last two weeks. One thing that surprised me is our group often has
						group discussions, and almost all members can participate in each discussion. Most of the team
						members are active in the process of completing this assignment</p>
					<p>For myself through this assignment, my ability to communicate and cooperate with other team
						members has improved. When some members put forward better opinions, I can correctly adopt their
						advantages. After finishing this assignment, I also have a deep understanding of our research
						project. I attended every group discussion on time. While listening to the suggestions of other
						team members, I can also put forward your own opinions. I can also quickly accomplish my part
						when I choose what I should do. What I can improve is the use and understanding of professional
						knowledge, especially programming ability. Improving these abilities will be very helpful for my
						future study career.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Erxun Liu</strong></p>
					<p> In this project, Everyone in our team tried their best. Each of us has made a lot of
						contributions to this project. Everyone in our team has good communication. For my part, I'm
						doing well and tried my best. What needs to be improved is that in the future, everyone needs to
						speak more actively in the meeting. What surprises me is that everyone is very efficient in
						completing their work.
					</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Ruilin Li</strong></p>
					<p> In Assignment 3, all group members made the advanced efforts and outstanding contributions to
						the group project. We actively participate in group discussion and attend group meetings twice a
						week. Generally, the atmosphere of our group is extremely harmonious. Although there is friction
						due to different perspectives between group members, it can always be solved peacefully.
						Conversely, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of completing our project. Because it is
						the final week, all members have enormous work to do. It is important to reasonably make a plan
						and finish it on time.</p>
					<p>For my personal improvement, it was my first time to learn basic knowledge about Information
						Technology. It really surprised me when I first made the visual website. During the process of
						researching our project, I did a deep digging about online learning platforms and I gained
						substantial knowledge about it. More importantly, I learned from my group members. It taught me
						the most crucial thing for a group to operate properly was cooperation. By working in this way,
						it can accelerate the efficiency of the project. Finally, I was so happy to be in this group,
						thanks for everyone!</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Haonan Jiang</strong></p>
					<p> In this assignment I was responsible for the project planning, it helps me think more about this
						software. This task on app designing was aimed at providing the university with an app interface
						capable of hosting online classes and video conferences. While designing the app, I felt most
						intrigued about the Agile Development approach. According to me, although the process involves
						repeatedly making changes to the prototype based on the feedback received from users, I feel its
						importance lies in making the app perfect with time. Also, I would also like to discuss the app
						scope. According to me, besides the university audience, the app can be used in other areas such
						as corporate sectors where managers can train their teams through online conferences. However,
						care needs to be taken regarding the app budget which shall exceed its given threshold owing to
						the myriad of functionalities that the app might contain. On the whole, this learning app has
						significant potential in terms of both working and profitability. By making this app a
						successful product on the Play Store and App Store, people will be able to download the same and
						each download volume will yield revenue. Through further OTA updates, we can also include a
						number of premium features as well. Through group meetings, group members provided a lot of
						interesting ideas and helped me figure out what functions we should have in our software.
						Appreciate!</p>

					<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
					<p>We reflect on this group assignment by various aspects, containing our pros and cons, the
						challenge we meet, the experience we learned, etc. At the beginning of this assignment, we got
						feedback from the tutor which pointed out our last group assignment was not satisfactory due to
						lack of creativity. It was the first challenge we met. Thus, we held a meeting regarding the
						change of group project. Two new ideas were proposed, which are an online medical service
						platform and online education platform. After our discussion and voting by all group members, we
						decided to work on the second one because there is stronger feasibility and lower legal risk.
						Since we started to research this kind of IT project, we found that there is a big potential
						market for the online education industry, especially during pandemic COVID-19, the market has
						increased dramatically. It is exactly what surprised us, we chose the correct direction to do
						research and most group members are very interested in the project. To complete this project
						perfectly, we have great communication and cooperation among group members, everyone is free to
						participate in discussion or debate, we believe that brainstorming can be the best way for
						increasing our creativity. In addition, we have great resource integration capability. Every
						group member contributes relevant materials and references, and each member would choose what
						kind of reference needed according to their own part. In fact, this is an effective way for
						saving time. However, there are still a couple of things we need to improve. Through the process
						we collected data, we recognized that data analysis is crucial to industry research and
						investigation. Most group members lack data collection and analysis ability. Practical data
						analysis could help us realize the current situation of certain industries and be useful to
						decision making. Furthermore, data virtualization is more understandable to present. On the
						other hand, we need to pay more attention to the accuracy and reliability of the materials or
						data we quoted. From this group project, we recognized the importance of group cooperation.
						Everyone has their own skilled field and contributes to various aspects of the whole project. In
						sum, we made much progress in the process of working on this group project. Everyone has a
						deeper understanding of the industry and boosts the ability of foundation skills. We will
						overcome more challenges in the future.</p>
